	      The Pekingese is a breed of Chinese dogs, known for over 4,000 years. It is called after Pekin, the former name of the capital of China, Beijing. In ancient China, it was reserved exclusively for the royal palace, cared for by the eunuchs, and the theft or the sale of a Pekingese were punished with death.</p>
